What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder that it uses to track changes made to files in the
repository. 
In order to use any of the version control features of git you have to first
create the repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to control what does, and does not, go into a
commit. Without a staging area the only choice would be to either add all
files in the directory to a commit, or add none. 
There are various reasons why one would need to select to not have ceratin
files added in a commit to a repository, such as vim swap files or
environmental configurations that contain senstive data that you not want to
make publically avaiable on GitHub.
