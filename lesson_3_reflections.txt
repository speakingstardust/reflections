When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I use remote repositories to be able to push my work to my production environment on Heroku. 
This would also be critical in a collaborative environment in which multiple people were editing 
and working on the same code base. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other users might push changes to the repository that would break or
otherwise in some way mess with what you are currently working on. 
Manually choosing when to pull, and when not to, makes it ultimately the
user's perogative to take the changes, or to switch to a new branch and not
take them.
